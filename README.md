## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **CNN-Based Adaptive Embedding** | Intelligent texture analysis for imperceptible hiding |
| 🔐 **AES-256 Encryption** | Military-grade security with PBKDF2 key derivation |
| 🛡️ **Attack Resistant** | Survives JPEG compression, resizing & filtering |
| 📊 **High Quality Output** | PSNR >40 dB, SSIM >0.99 — visually identical |
| ⚡ **GPU Accelerated** | Fast processing with CUDA support |
| 🎯 **Blind Extraction** | No original image needed for decoding |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ▶️ Embed a Message
1. Upload your cover image (PNG/JPEG)
2. Type your secret message
3. Set a strong password (16+ characters recommended)
4. Choose a robustness level
5. Download the stego image

### 🔍 Extract a Message
1. Upload the stego image
2. Enter the correct password
3. Click Extract — your hidden message is revealed

---

## 🎚️ Robustness Levels

| Level | Quality | Capacity | Attack Resistance | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **None** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 100% | None | Trusted local channels |
| **Low** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 80% | Light JPEG | Social media platforms |
| **Medium** | ⭐⭐⭐ | 27% | JPEG QF 75+ | Messaging apps |
| **High** | ⭐⭐ | 16% | Maximum protection | Hostile environments |

## 🔬 How It Works

```
Cover Image → LWT Transform → CNN Mask → AES-256 Encrypt → LSB Embed → Stego Image
                                                                              ↓
                                                                       Extraction ← Password
```

1. **Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT)** — Decomposes the image into frequency sub-bands
2. **CNN Texture Analysis** — A lightweight CNN generates a texture-aware embedding mask
3. **AES-256-CBC Encryption** — Message is encrypted with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation
4. **Error Correction & Replication** — Optional redundancy for robustness against attacks
5. **LSB Matching Embedding** — Bits are embedded in the frequency domain using the CNN mask
6. **Blind Extraction** — Decoder reconstructs the message using only the password

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **PSNR** | 40–48 dB |
| **SSIM** | 0.96–0.99 |
| **Capacity** | 8–128 KB (varies by image & robustness) |
| **Processing Speed** | 2–15 seconds (GPU accelerated) |

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Always use a **strong, unique password** (16+ characters)
- The system uses **AES-256-CBC** with a random IV per message
- Keys are derived using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** with 100,000 iterations
- For maximum security, use **None** robustness level and share stego images over trusted channels only
